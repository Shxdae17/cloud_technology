    Born July 17, 1994, Karly-Marina Loaiza, better known as Kali Uchis, is a Colombian-American singer and songwriter. 
    Kali was raised in her parents' native Colombia before violence forced them to flee back to the US in 2000. 
    Home life was often chaotic, with her parents and four older siblings joined by a rotating cast of relatives who'd come from Pereira to find work. 
    In school she played saxophone and piano, eventually becoming first chair of the jazz band. 
    At the age of 17, Kali Uchis was thrown out of her parents' house for repeatedly breaking her curfew. 
    For months she lived out of her car, staying with friends when she could and working in a grocery store to make ends meet.
    Shortly after moving back into her old bedroom, in August 2012, the teenager summoned up the courage to post some of her music online.
    Making 17 songs in one night, not expecting anyone to hear it, she later was proven wrong as her lofi mixtape 'Drunken Babble' caught the atention of artists like Snoop Dogg, Gorillaz, and Tyler, the Creator who invited her to appear on their albums. 
    But that wasnt all for Kali. Her next releases 'Ridin' Round' and 'Know What I Want' racked up more thena 10 million views on Youtube. Gaining many loyal fans throughout her career, Uchis has since released 3 albums, with the newest being 'Red Moon in Venus'. Kali Uchis is set to release her next album 'Orquideas' early 2024.
